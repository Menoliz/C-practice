# C sharp -practice
Learning C# on Visual Studio

Learned basically from scratch through various courses (Udemy) and websites 

As practice numbers increase (Practice 1, Practice 2 ... Practice 5) the difficulty of code increases (for the most part) or new elements are introduced.

Practice folder contain code i wrote myself from practice i did while volunteering in Germany, using various website sources, videos. 

The code in these is RE-WRITTEN and more optomized than when it was first written (when i would complete a task given from a lecture or lesson, i would come back and write it again, making it shorter and better, that is why it is second time written).

Folder explanation:

Practice 1 is basic if-else statements.
Practice 2 is for,array, foreach code.
Practice 3 is creating and manipulating lists
Practice 4 is timespan, char, string code
Practice 5 is analyzing .txt files, finding filepath, analyzing text, creating new text.
Personal projects is code i created to experiment with. Enums, .txt file analysis, stringbuilding a passowrd
